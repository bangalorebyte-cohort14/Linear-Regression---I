Predict the "tip" a waiter recieves using the variables in the dataset. Be sure to conduct data exploration - you have a good idea of which variables are relevant BEFORE you apply the model.

You should have a few models: your base model (with all variables) and others with intelligent choices of variables. (backed by data exploration or hypothesis testing). Your final model should be the one which had the smallest difference between train and test dataset.
